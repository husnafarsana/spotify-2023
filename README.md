# spotify-2023
This project focuses on building an interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard using the Spotify 2023 dataset. To begin, the raw dataset was provided in Excel format, which required several cleaning and preprocessing steps before moving into the visualization stage. Tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting inconsistent formats, and splitting combined columns were carefully performed in Excel to ensure accuracy and reliability of the dataset. Once cleaned, the dataset was seamlessly imported into Power BI for further modeling and visualization.

Within Power BI, I developed multiple dashboards that provide insights into different aspects of Spotifyâ€™s streaming data. The project highlights Artists Names,Dates,Streams,counts of track_name,sum of bpm,count of keys etc supported by interactive charts, filters, and KPIs. For example, a donut chart was used to show the top 10 artists by total streams, while bar and line charts were applied to analyze sum of streams by track_name, count of track_name by Date.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, DAX calculations, and dashboard design. It is highly valuable for anyone looking to explore Spotify music trends in 2023, while also serving as a strong portfolio project for showcasing data analysis and visualization expertise. The dashboard makes raw data engaging and actionable, offering clear insights into the world of music streaming.
